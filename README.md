# KeyMapper
This is a simple Java 17 application to open a key-binds file for Elite Dangerous and fill in all of the empty keys with unused key combinations

## Description
This will take a partially filled keymap file formatted by Elite Dangerous.
The program will find all of the un-used acceptable key-combinations and all of the un-mapped keys.
The prorgam will fll the file with unused combinations.
The program will output a new keymap file that is 100% filled

## Motivation
I created this because I was tryign to setup and use VoiceAttack in Elite Dangerous. Voice Attack will take your voice commands and execute the corresponding keyboard-map in-game. Clearly, this does not work for any items that don't have a key-map available. This enabled all commands to be immediately accessible in-game.
